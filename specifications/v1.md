# `.xff` specification v1

> [!note]
> *Version 1 was finalised on the 22nd of August 2024.*

Version 1 has evolved the `.xff` specification from a very simple, to a more complex format akin to a binary JSON variation capable of storing arbitrary data.

This version of the `.xff` specification differs significantly from version 0 and is this incompatible with it and any files created using it.

`.xff` stands for `xqhares file format` or `xqhared file format`, pronounced `squares file format` or `squared file format`.

The binary data in `.xff` is encoded in a custom [ASCII](xff-byte-encoding.md) variation, using Windows-1252 as its base.
Any mention of [ASCII](xff-byte-encoding.md) is to be understood to be referring to [this](xff-byte-encoding.md) subset specifically. 

`.xff` is capable of holding any kind of data and practically any amount of it (any-one value tops out at 1.2e614 bytes - that is 7.6 times more bytes than there are atoms in the universe).
The `.xff` format itself has no maximum file size.

Every `.xff` file starts with one byte (8 bits) encoding the current version of the `.xff` specification.
Any implementation of the `.xff` specification should be able to read any version of the specification, but may choose to only support any set of versions or version.

Seven value types can be stored in `.xff` files:

1. Strings
2. Numbers
3. Data
4. Arrays
5. Objects
6. Boolean's
7. Null

Any row wrapped by `VER` and `EM` in the diagram below is considered a single value.

A `.xff` file may never contain zero values.

## Length attribute

Every value type has a length attribute except for `Booleans` and `Null`.

The length attribute is split in two parts:\
First is one byte, encoding the length in bytes of the following length.\
Second are as many bytes as indicated by the first byte.

This specification allows implementations to set arbitrary limits on the range of length accepted, but it recommends the implementation of up to 8 bytes of length.

If for example the first byte is set to one, the length is the following byte.\
Should the first byte be four, the length is encoded in the following four bytes.

The first byte may never be 0.

All length data is encoded in binary using the Little-Endian byte-ordering, and always refers to the length in bytes of the following data.

> [!note]
> This means that the largest possible length is 1.2e614.\
> To encode the length of 1 petabyte of data in bytes you would only have to use 8 bytes of the 255 available.

## Strings

The makeup of a `String` is the same as in version 0.

Strings have to be encoded in [ASCII](xff-byte-encoding.md).

Command character codes 8 through 13 are permissible in a `String`.

`TXT` is the start and end of any text encoded in [ASCII](xff-byte-encoding.md).
The trailing `TXT` provides an additional check of the length of the data to validate it.

## Numbers

The makeup of a `Number` differs completely from version 0.

Version 1 defines a valid `Number` as a sequence of decimal digits (`0` to `9`) with no superfluous leading zero, containing a single `.` or `,` decimal separator between digits.

'`.`' and '`,`' represent a decimal point.
Only one '`.`' or '`,`' is allowed per `Number`.

A '`-`' (minus sign) may only be used as the first character, and only one '`-`' is allowed.
The presence of a '`-`' marks the number as negative.

`NaN` and `Infinity` are not a valid `Number`.

No command characters may be used.

This specification allows implementations to set arbitrary limits on the range and precision of numbers accepted, but it recommends the implementation of IEEE 754 binary64.

## Data

`.xff` files can store arbitrary data by wrapping it in `DAT`, along with its length.

All data enclosed by `DAT` is considered one unified data-stream that is stored as-is and may not be changed in any way.

The closing `DAT` serves as another check of the length of the data.

## Array

An array may consist of any number of values of any type. The total length of all elements is limited to 1.2e614 bytes.

Arrays may contain more arrays with no limit set on the amount of nesting.

The elements are separated by `RS`.

The array may be closed with a trailing `RS` or without.

## Object

An object may consist of any number of key-value pairs. One object has the theoretical maximum size of 1.2e614 bytes.

The keys have to be `Strings`, the values are of any type.

Objects may contain more objects with no limit set on the amount of nesting.

The pairs are enclosed by `GS`, the key and the value are separated by `US`.
The key-value pairs are separated by `RS`.

The object may be closed with a trailing `RS` or without.

## Boolean

A boolean can be either `true` or `false`, represented by `TRU` and `FAL` respectively.

## Null / None

A null value is represented by `NUL`.

## End of file

`EM` is the end of the `.xff` file.

## Musings about a future version 1

- Make a custom byte map?
- Make Numbers their own value? Maybe?
    - Save scientific notation as Strings so that we do not lose precision for extreme numbers like in v0.
- A way to represent arrays of data in byte form directly in `.xff` would be nice.
    - I am continuously running into the need to at least be able to store key-value pairs in `.xff` files.
- Some kind of optional metadata for any data, be it strings, data or even command characters.
- Maybe integrate an object store directly, solving all of the above?
- Think about what to do with features, implement version dependent read and write functions?
- Everything gets a length attribute. For performance.
    - Variable amount of length-bytes by prepending a single byte encoding the length of the length-bytes. Maximum length possible: 1.2E614 bytes - Length of a Petabyte: 1e15 which needs only 8 bytes.
