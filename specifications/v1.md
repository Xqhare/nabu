# `.xff` specification v1

> [!note]
> ***This version is not yet finalized.***

## Musings about a future version 1

- A way to represent arrays of data in byte form directly in `.xff` would be nice.
    - I am continuously running into the need to at least be able to store key-value pairs in `.xff` files.
- Some kind of optional metadata for any data, be it strings, data or even command characters.
- Think about what to do with features, implement version dependent read and write functions?
- Everything gets a length attribute.
